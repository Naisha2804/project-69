                <p>I highly recommend Harry Potter to those who enjoy whimsical fantasy novel reads that can easily captivate you into an intense and layered storyline of loss and hardship but also happiness and victory. The Harry Potter series is very well-executed, with exciting plot twists and odd questions. Even when the series is over, there are still questions to be asked and answered.
                    The mark of a good book series is that it keeps you coming back. Harry Potter certainly keeps me coming, as I have now read the series four times over the past two or so years. Experiencing this magical world once isn't enough. You'll begin to notice smaller details as you read once again through the series, while others may take significantly longer to notice and understand. You may come back knowing a word you didn't know previously and so forth.
                    But through this all, one thing stands clear for Harry Potter. It is a timeless classic, one that, no matter what, will be remembered throughout the centuries and read by many different generations in the world.

            <p>5.0 out of 5 stars Great series for kids. My nine year old daughter loves this series and all the Thea Stilton books. She reads them over and over again! Though some of the words are mouse lingo, the story lines are great and kids get a glimpse of things about the world outside of their immediate environment.</p>
